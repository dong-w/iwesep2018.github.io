               The objective of the 8th International Workshop on Empirical Software Engineering in Practice (IWESEP) is to foster the development of the area by providing a forum where researchers and practitioners can report on and discuss new research results and applications in the area of empirical software engineering. The workshop encourages the exchange of ideas within the international community to better understand, from an empirical viewpoint, the strengths and weaknesses of technology in use and new technologies, with the expectation of furthering the field of software engineering.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                The workshop focuses on the process, design, and structure of empirical studies as well as the results of specific studies. The workshop welcomes both original and replicated studies, varying from controlled experiments to field studies, from quantitative to qualitative. We solicit the following two types of submissions: full research papers (max 6 pages) for oral presentations and abstracts (max 700 words) for poster presentations. Please check the website for more information.
              </p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Empirical studies of software process and product</li>
                <li>Comparison of cost estimation techniques</li>
                <li>Analysis of the effects of design methods and characteristics</li>
                <li>Evaluation of the readability of coding styles</li>
                <li>How is it possible to preserve developer and company privacy when
   recording interaction histories?</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="text-justify">
                We believe that the research community can benefit of a specific venue to openly present new ideas to address the open problems above, identify new issues, and foster new collaborations that may result in solid research results and advancements on the state of the art. We solicit the following types of submissions:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Research papers (6-8 pages + up to 2 pages of references)</li>
                <li>Position papers (2-4 pages + 1 page of references)</li>
                <li>Tool/IDE Plugins/Dataset Showcase (2-4 pages + 1 page of references)</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="text-justify">
                All submissions will go through a rigorous reviewing process in which every valid submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. As with SANER 2018, our workshop also follows a full double-blind review process.
